Flight Insurance Explanation
This flight insurance system is built on a blockchain-based insurance framework called GIF (Global Insurance Framework). Here's how it works:
1. Insurance Structure
Flight Insurance Product: The system provides insurance against flight delays, cancellations, or diversions.
Payouts are tiered based on the degree of disruption:
Delays of 15-30 minutes
Delays of 30-45 minutes
Delays of 45+ minutes
Flight cancellations
Flight diversions

2. Policy Purchase Process
Customer selects a flight they want to insure by providing flight data (airline code, flight number, departure/arrival airports, and date).
Premium calculation is based on statistics of the flight's historical performance. The premium amount reflects the risk of delay/cancellation.
Payouts are calculated at the time of purchase based on the premium amount, with maximum caps to limit risk exposure.
Policy creation involves:
Validating flight details
Checking time constraints (policies must be purchased within a specific window before departure)
Collecting premium payment (via tokens/cryptocurrency)
Issuing a policy NFT to the customer

3. Risk Assessment and Pricing
The system uses historical flight data to calculate risk, using a weighted pattern for different disruption types.
A minimum number of historical observations is required to ensure statistical validity.
Premium amounts have both minimum and maximum limits.
Maximum payout amounts are capped for individual policies and total risk per flight.
The system includes a margin percentage to ensure financial stability.

4. Claims Processing
Oracle Service: An external oracle service monitors flight status and reports back to the smart contract.
Automatic Triggers: Claims are triggered automatically based on flight status data:
Status codes ('L' for Late, 'C' for Cancelled, 'D' for Diverted)
Delay duration in minutes
No Manual Claims: Customers don't need to submit claims; payouts are triggered automatically when conditions are met.

5. Payout Process
When flight status data is received, the contract determines the appropriate payout option.
Policies are processed in batches (configurable maximum number per transaction).
Payouts are made directly to the policyholder's wallet.
The policy is closed after payout.

6. Technical Safeguards
Time Constraints: Policies can only be purchased within specific time windows before departure.
Risk Concentration Limits: The system prevents too much insurance being sold for a single flight (cluster risk).
Test Mode: For testing purposes, time constraints can be disabled.
Permissioned Roles: Different functions are restricted to authorized participants only.

7. Special Features
Permit-based Premium Collection: Allows premium collection using token permits without requiring a separate approval transaction.
Bundle System: Policies are backed by risk capital bundles that provide the funds for payouts.
This flight insurance product demonstrates how blockchain technology can be used to create transparent, efficient insurance products with automatic claims processing, reducing the need for manual intervention and providing quick payouts to customers when flight disruptions occur.




Oracle Trust Minimization
To address your concern about trusting the oracle data, we can implement several safeguards:
Multi-Oracle Consensus: Require data to be signed by multiple independent flight data providers
Delayed Finality: Allow a challenge period for incorrect flight database entries
Public Verifiability: Make the flight database publicly queryable, even though individual policies remain private
Cryptographic Attestation: Have oracles sign their datasets with secure timestamps
